## Project Overview
Hydropower is the main source of electricity in Manitoba, and its performance strongly depends on the amount and timing of river inflows to reservoirs. In cold regions such as northern Manitoba, streamflow is mainly controlled by winter snow accumulation, snowmelt processes, and delayed climate effects rather than same-season precipitation.

This project investigates the **seasonal predictability of river inflows** at two major hydroelectric stations in Manitoba—**Long Spruce** and **Kettle**—using historical hydro-climatic data and large-scale climate drivers. The main focus is on understanding whether **lagged climate variables** (from previous seasons) provide better predictive skill than same-season variables.

## Objectives
The main objectives of this project are:
- To analyze long-term hydro-climatic behaviour of rivers in northern Manitoba
- To examine seasonal relationships between streamflow, precipitation, temperature, and snow
- To compare lagged and non-lagged climate predictors
- To evaluate the skill of empirical seasonal forecasting models
- To assess the usefulness of seasonal forecasts for hydropower operations

---

## Methodology
The analysis follows the same framework for both stations:
- Collection and quality control of historical hydrological and climate data
- Seasonal aggregation of variables (DJF, MAM, JJA, SON)
- Correlation and lag analysis between climate variables and streamflow
- Development and evaluation of empirical seasonal prediction models
- Comparison of lag-based models versus no-lag models

Most analyses were performed using statistical methods and empirical modelling tools, supported by exploratory data analysis and visualization.

## Key Findings
- No significant long-term trend was detected in annual streamflow at either station.
- Same-season precipitation and temperature show weak or no direct relationship with streamflow.
- Lagged climate variables, especially winter and spring snow and precipitation, provide stronger explanatory power.
- Lag-based models outperform no-lag models for seasonal streamflow prediction.
- Forecast skill is generally higher for identifying low-flow (dry) conditions than high-flow conditions.
- Results confirm that streamflow in northern Manitoba is primarily controlled by cold-season storage and snowmelt processes.
